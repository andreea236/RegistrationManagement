# RegistrationManagement
The project uses OOP concepts to manage registrations. It consists of 3 parts: 
-a representation of a participant (Guest class); 
-a class that implements the management of the list of participants (class GuestsList);
-a main class, which will accept orders from the user, will perform the appropriate actions on the participation lists and will answer queries (class Main).
